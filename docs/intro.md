# Carburetor 10-What?

This is a short docs-as-code approach to one of life's greatest mysteries. The carburetor. 

So mysterious... It sounds Italian. Like Fragile'. Except I don't think it is. It's from the word carbonara, which is Italian. Or is it greek? I think it was meant to sound Italian, but not actually BE Italian per-se. Pretty sure I just made that up. 

Wait... where was I?

Utilizing Markdown and basic JSON edits in Docusaurus. I'll finally answer some of your most burning mechanical and stochiometric questions. I'm talking we'll go over the single most awesomely-ultimate shortened, feature-length, and detailed list of the basics of carburetion in gasoline-powered motors... and YES, I will answer what a carburetor is. Mystery solved. No Scooby-Doo hood pulls here.
